#Famous MVC Project Overview
The Famo.us todo applications were written for Famous by software engineer consultants Shane Keller , Naman Goel, and Chris Oliver. The apps are based on the elegant and functional “Clear” iphone todo app which showcases the power of Famo.us animations, and provide a solid model for integrating Famo.us with Backbone, Angular, and Meteor, making it easier for thousands of developers to learn and love Famo.us.
